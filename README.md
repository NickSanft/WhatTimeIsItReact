This is a quick project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The purpose of this repo is for some initial testing to see how react can be used to build web applications. This quick example simply has a filterable dropdown of all known timezones, which when selected shows the user the current time for that given timezone.
